 * Example configuration file for the BeansBooks API system.
 *
 * Just contains the hostname and auth credentials necessary for the system.
 *
 * If your framework or application already has a configuration setting or system,
 * it is highly recommended to simply copy these into that system!
 *
 * If you choose to use the boilerplate application, <b>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY</b>!
 * Copy this file to "config.php" and edit that instead.
